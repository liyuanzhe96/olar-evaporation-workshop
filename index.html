      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past decade, solar interfacial evaporation has gained attention as a promising strategy for applications including desalination, wastewater treatment, and mineral extraction. 
        Notably, numerous studies have reported evaporation rates that appear to exceed the conventional thermal limit. 
        The underlying mechanisms behind this so-called super-thermal performance remain an active and evolving topic of scientific inquiry.

      <h2>Workshop Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Critically evaluate the experimental evidence for super-thermal solar interfacial evaporation.</li>
        <li>Discuss potential physical mechanisms that could account for observed super-thermal behavior.</li>
        <li>Explore the feasibility of launching an international round-robin study using same materials.</li>
      </ul>
