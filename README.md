# International Workshop on Solar Interfacial Evaporation

**📅 December 19–21, 2025 (tentative)**  
**📍 Tokyo, Japan (Exact Venue TBD)**  
**🏫 Hosted by The University of Tokyo**

## 🔬 Workshop Overview

Over the past decade, solar interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising strategy for applications in desalination, wastewater treatment, and mineral extraction. Interestingly, many recent studies have reported evaporation rates that exceed the conventional thermal limit, prompting questions about the mechanisms behind this "super-thermal" behavior.

This international workshop brings together leading experts to critically evaluate the evidence, explore potential explanations, and chart a path forward for collaborative research.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess experimental claims of super-thermal performance in solar evaporation.
- Discuss physical mechanisms and material properties that may explain the phenomena.
- Explore an international round-robin study using standardized materials.
